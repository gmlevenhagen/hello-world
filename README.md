      Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a dog named Axel and he was wondering what would become of his life and he decided that he would look for something new to do with his life. He pondered and wondered. Adventuring across the land looking for his purpose in life. Then one day he might this pretty lady that showed true compassion for him and cleared his mind and gave him purpose in life. He then realized what his career path would be as before it was clouded by alcohol and mindless thoughts.
